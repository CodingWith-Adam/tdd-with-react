# Test Driven Development With React

In this video we learn how to apply Test Driven Development(TDD) to a react application. TDD is a test first approach. That means you write a failing test first. After the test is written you write the code to make it pass.  

We will create an application using TDD and the amazing part is that we will only run the application at the end of the video. That means we will rely 100% on your unit tests. 

The testing library that will use is called Testing Library(https://testing-library.com/). When you use npx create react app it comes preloaded.
